# CSE_278_Lab03
Q1 has many different functions, the first thing is the user will input a string. That string will have different methods ran on it including returning the number of letters, 
digits, numbers in it. As well as if the word "miami" is contained inside it. It will then ask if the user wants their string converted to all uppercase or lowercase.
Entering a 1 will display all uppercase and a 2 will display all lowercase. The other thing is that the first three methods are included into one function and displayed again
Q2 will ask for two numbers and run a swap function using pointers. For the extra credit the user is asked to input two more numbers and a swap function is ran using references
Q3 will have the user input 15 numbers into an array. Ignoring the first number and last number as well as  without the boundary the indexes of local minimum and maximum are returned
